### [2019-01-28] Challenge #374 [Easy] Additive Persistence [https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/akv6z4/20190128_challenge_374_easy_additive_persistence/]

Inspired by this tweet, today's challenge is to calculate the additive persistence of a number, defined as how many loops you have to do summing its digits until you get a single digit number. Take an integer N:

Add its digits

Repeat until the result has 1 digit

The total number of iterations is the additive persistence of N.

Your challenge today is to implement a function that calculates the additive persistence of a number.

Examples
13 -> 1
1234 -> 2
9876 -> 2
199 -> 3
